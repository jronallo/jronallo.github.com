I recently launched my first web application. [Handlist](http://handlist.ronallo.com/) takes a file of MARC records and turns them into an alphabetically sorted book catalog of titles, authors and subject headings.

It was mostly an excuse to use [merb](http://merbivore.com/) and learn some web programming, but the gem that I wrote behind it was useful for me in a part-time job, so maybe it will be useful for someone else.

If you have a file of some MARC records handy (and less than 2MB) could you give it a test? What could I have done differently? Since I'm new to this I'm all ears. Hopefully soon I'll post about some of the things I learned while working on this project.
