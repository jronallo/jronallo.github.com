## 2013

Here are some presentations I've given. I just started adding these mid-2013, so I've got to go back and add some others.

### Embedded Semantic Markup, schema.org, the Common Crawl, and Web Data Commons: What Big Web Data Means for Libraries and Archives

Presentation given at the TRLN 2013 Annual Meeting.
