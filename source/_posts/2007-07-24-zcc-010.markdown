I just released version 0.1.0 of zcc, my Ruby copy cataloging script. Lot's of improvements and new features. Find out more here:

I'm really happy with the progress I've made with this release. Finally I think I'm starting to get Object Oriented programming. I rewrote much of the code to create reusable classes in the hopes that I could play with some of the same code with a simple Rails based application.
