This is a curated list of some of [my pinboard bookmarks](http://pinboard.in/u:jronallo) in areas where I have done research or otherwise focused. Only the most recent are below. Click on the header for more. Right now these are mostly about Microdata and Schema.org and serve as supplementary material to an forthcoming article on the topic.

[Microdata Cultural Heritage Examples](http://pinboard.in/u:jronallo/t:microdata/t:example)
------------------------------------

These are especially examples relevant to the cultural heritage sector.
