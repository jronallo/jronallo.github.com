This is the blog of Jason Ronallo for all things having to do with digital
libraries and software development. I am the [Associate Head of Digital
Library Initiatives](http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/staff/jnronall/) 
(formerly Digital Collections Technology Librarian) at
[North Carolina State University Libraries](http://www.lib.ncsu.edu). 
Technologies I use most often these days are Ruby, Rails, jQuery, Solr, and
[Blacklight](http://projectblacklight.org/). You can learn more about my 
background on [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/jronallo).
