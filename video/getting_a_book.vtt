00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.616
Once you've used the library's online catalog to identify a book you want, you have to go get the book.

2
00:00:08.616 --> 00:00:13.308
On the bottom of a book's catalog page, there's information about the location of the book.

3
00:00:13.308 --> 00:00:17.928
This book is located in DH Hill Library, in the stacks, on the 8th floor.

4
00:00:17.928 --> 00:00:23.184
It's important to note whether the book is in DH Hill Library, because there are other libraries on campus as well.

5
00:00:23.184 --> 00:00:28.334
The catalog also shows that the book is available, meaning it's not checked out, and it's on the shelf.

6
00:00:28.334 --> 00:00:31.521
Now you can use the book's call number to find the book on the shelf.

7
00:00:31.521 --> 00:00:34.491
The call number is a unique identifier for the book.

8
00:00:34.491 --> 00:00:38.386
The call number in the catalog record, and on the spine of the book, are the same.

9
00:00:38.386 --> 00:00:43.023
To find the book on the shelf, you'll want to write down the call number and bring it with you.

10
00:00:43.023 --> 00:00:49.317
Or, if you don't have a pen handy, you can click "text" to send a text message of the book's catalog record to your phone.

11
00:00:49.317 --> 00:00:54.759
Now that you know your book's call number, it's time to go get your book.

12
00:00:54.759 --> 00:01:00.144
Since this book is in DH Library, you'll need to take the elevator to the correct floor of the bookstacks.

13
00:01:00.144 --> 00:01:04.103
If you forget what floor your book is on, there are maps next to, and inside the elevators.

14
00:01:04.103 --> 00:01:06.710
The maps show which books are on which floors.

15
00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.489
The letters on the map are the same as at the beginning of your book's call number.

16
00:01:10.489 --> 00:01:15.410
Since your book's call number begins with the letters SF, you can tell it's on the eighth floor.

17
00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:18.432
Once you're on the right floor, check out the signs on the shelves.

18
00:01:18.432 --> 00:01:21.646
Each sign tells you the range of call numbers located on that shelf.

19
00:01:21.646 --> 00:01:24.073
Look for the range that contains your call number

20
00:01:24.073 --> 00:01:29.554
Once you've found the right shelf, Scan the call numbers on the shelf and go in order until you find your book.

21
00:01:29.554 --> 00:01:31.600
The call number will match exactly.

22
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.874
Once you have your book, you can take it to the circulation desk on the first floor to check it out.

23
00:01:36.874 --> 00:01:45.763
If you ever get confused while getting your book, just ask a librarian for help, in person, or through the online "ask us" chat service, on the library's website.
