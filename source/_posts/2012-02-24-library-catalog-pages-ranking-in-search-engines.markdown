Recently there was a thread on the code4lib list about [local catalog records being in the search engines](http://www.mail-archive.com/code4lib@listserv.nd.edu/msg13356.html) like Google, Bing, and Yahoo!. The anecdotal evidence is that Google is [actively crawling and indexing library catalogs like Johns Hopkins](http://www.mail-archive.com/code4lib@listserv.nd.edu/msg13360.html). 

Some of the discussion has revolved around how useful this local catalog data is to folks coming from search engines. For How many of these users are satisfied with coming to the local catalog? I think many people will be unsatisfied because they have found something interesting that they cannot access. Much of what academic libraries have is only available to their own students, faculty, and staff or to other institutions through inter-library loan. I think the situation may be improving.

## User Data

One way these kinds of searches are improving is through the search engines knowing more about user preferences and browsing history. It seems that changes to Google's privacy policy means that more data will be shared between applications. If a user is logged in to a Google product it will be possible to have this data effect search relevancy. If Google knows I visit the library catalog often, then it could push results for the catalog up for relevant searches. This kind of service certainly is not uncontroversial, but it appears that use of this kind of data to effect relevancy will be happening more often.

Increasingly data about people comes to search engines through social networks. Facebook and Google+ are collecting information about user preferences that can be worked into search. Social connections and their preferences are starting to figure in to the ranking algorithm. So my social circles are starting to change what results show up on the first page. It is interesting to see the results with this social component added in compared with it removed. While many will turn off or away from these new factors to search ranking, there are some ways library catalogs and other interfaces could be improved for those who opt in.

## Location vs. Affiliation

One suggestion is that the user's geographic location could figure in to which library catalogs show up in results. This is a very rough way of determining relevance. It may work for public libraries, but does not work well for academic libraries. I could live right next door to a university with a fabulous library, but have no rights to access the collections. 

This is basically how [WorldCat](http://www.worldcat.org/) works to determine relevance by location. The problem is that it shows me all results even those over 100 miles away from my current location. It is not until you get to the view of an individual resource does it tell me that it is too far away. Even if the search engines used my location along with location data from WorldCat the results may still not be relevant or something I could borrow.

Geographic location has been a crude surrogate for personal relevance. What would be better would be for the search engines to use affiliation. Affiliation more accurate for determining an appropriate copy. The motivation for search engines to use affiliation to effect relevance is, as usual, to improve the user experience. Folks already use search engines to find content on their institutional websites that have poor information architecture or search capabilities. This is not something that is specific to library catalogs, but cuts across information from an institution.

Google+ already knows my current work affiliation. How does a search engine use that information to make results from the local catalog rank higher? The missing component is for the library catalog (or any institutional site) to advertise institutional ownership. 

URLs already does this in some cases, but there is no explicit link between the text of the institution name I enter into a social network profile and the URL. In other cases, library catalogs and other applications are hosted by third parties so not within the institutional domain.

Another approach that could work across these cases is to use embedded semantic markup to effectively brand a site for machines like crawlers. 

YKK Give example.

This might be enough of a hint to the search engines to give a boost to content from my institution.

YKK identifiers on both ends

There is more that needs to be worked out for affiliation to work like this more generally. Sometimes you may have the right to borrow something as part of a consortium that does not share a name with

So in some ways this would be a basic kind of appropriate copy relevancy boost and in the same space as our link resolvers.

In the academic library context I wonder to what extent the data from Google Apps like campus Gmail is allowed to be folded in to the other data about a person? This institutional connection could be a clear way for library catalogs to increase in relevance for these users.
